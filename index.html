## Status

Even though Helmfile is used in production environments [across multiple organizations](USERS.md), it is still in its early stage of development, hence versioned 0.x.

Helmfile complies to Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 in which v0.x means that there could be backward-incompatible changes for every release.

Note that we will try our best to document any backward incompatibility. And in reality, helmfile had no breaking change for a year or so.
